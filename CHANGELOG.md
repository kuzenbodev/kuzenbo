# Changelog

This file is a lightweight index for Kuzenbo releases.

## Policy

- Canonical release notes are stored in `_internal_docs/releases/<version>.md`.
- This index should stay concise and link to the canonical notes.

## Unreleased

- Migrated release versioning internals to native Changesets workflow.
- Enforced two-channel release lanes (`next` prerelease and `stable`), both from `main`.
