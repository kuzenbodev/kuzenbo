# Base UI Handbook: Foundations

Use this skill when a question is cross-component and not about one concrete component’s API.

## Scope

- Styling model (`className`, `style`, `render`, state callbacks)
- CSS hooks (`data-*` state attrs, CSS vars, data attributes from popup placement)
- Animation and transition attributes
- Composition patterns with nested `render` callbacks
- Customization and behavior tuning (`open`, `onOpenChange`, reason-based handlers)

## Routing cues

- "style hooks", "Tailwind", "CSS module", "composition", "render prop", "animation", "transition", "customization", "custom behavior", "event reason" → this skill
