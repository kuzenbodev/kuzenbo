## What Patterns Means In Kuzenbo

Patterns in this docs section are repeatable implementation decisions, not just component examples. They help teams ship consistent behavior across app surfaces while preserving package boundaries.

## Pattern Areas

- [Composition](/docs/patterns/composition): building reusable APIs with explicit slots and predictable ownership.
- [Forms](/docs/patterns/forms): structuring validation, error states, and field semantics.
- [Navigation Patterns](/docs/patterns/navigation-patterns): menus, sidebars, and route transitions.
- [Overlay Patterns](/docs/patterns/overlay-patterns): dialog, drawer, sheet, popover, and tooltip layering.
- [Migration](/docs/patterns/migration): safe upgrade paths and regression control.

## Cross-Cutting Rules

1. Prefer Base UI `render` composition over `asChild` for new work.
2. Use semantic color tokens (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`) instead of raw palette classes.
3. Prefer Kuzenbo typography primitives over ad-hoc text utility styling.
4. Keep hook logic in hook-owning packages and UI composition in UI-owning packages.

## Example: Composition-First Trigger

```tsx
import { Button, Dialog } from "@kuzenbo/core";

export const DeleteDialog = () => (
  <Dialog>
    <Dialog.Trigger render={<Button variant="danger" />}>
      Delete project
    </Dialog.Trigger>
    <Dialog.Content>
      <Dialog.Header>
        <Dialog.Title>Delete project</Dialog.Title>
        <Dialog.Description>
          This action is permanent and cannot be undone.
        </Dialog.Description>
      </Dialog.Header>
    </Dialog.Content>
  </Dialog>
);
```

## Accessibility and Performance Expectations

- Test keyboard interaction flows for all pattern-level interactions, not just component rendering.
- Keep focus transitions deterministic when patterns cross route boundaries or overlays.
- Avoid introducing expensive state synchronization in layout-level components when local state is enough.

## Review Checklist For Pattern Changes

- Pattern documentation updated in the same change set.
- Stories cover new states and interaction edges.
- Tests include regression coverage for reported bugs.
- Boundaries remain valid (`hooks` package stays independent from `core`).
