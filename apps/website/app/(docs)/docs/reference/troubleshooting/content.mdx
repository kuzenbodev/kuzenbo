## Styling Looks Unthemed

- Ensure `@kuzenbo/theme/prebuilt/kuzenbo.css` is imported.
- Add `@kuzenbo/styles/recommended.css` only if you want optional global baseline styles.
- Prefer semantic token classes instead of raw palette values.

## Theme Hydration Mismatch

- Render `ThemeBootstrapScript` before visible app content.
- Keep `ThemeProvider` wrapping UI that reads theme state.
- Confirm server and client use the same initial theme strategy.

## Import Errors

- Import from package entrypoints (for example `@kuzenbo/core`, `@kuzenbo/charts`).
- Avoid deep internal paths because they are not stable public API.
- Check that related Kuzenbo packages are on compatible versions.

## Chart Tooltip or Legend Issues

- Verify theme CSS is loaded so chart tokens resolve.
- Ensure chart hooks are called inside `Chart.Root` or `Chart.Provider`.
- Use portal targets when overlays need controlled stacking.

## Fast Triage Flow

1. Isolate the problem in the smallest component example.
2. Confirm package versions and runtime compatibility.
3. Compare behavior with the relevant docs example.
4. If still blocked, open a support issue with reproduction details.
