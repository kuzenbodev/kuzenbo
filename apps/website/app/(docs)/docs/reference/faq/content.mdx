faq:
  - question: "Which packages are public and supported?"
    answer: "The public scope is @kuzenbo/core, @kuzenbo/hooks, @kuzenbo/charts, @kuzenbo/notifications, @kuzenbo/date, @kuzenbo/ai, @kuzenbo/datatable, @kuzenbo/theme, and @kuzenbo/styles."
  - question: "Are all workspace packages meant for public use?"
    answer: "No. Some packages are internal tooling or still evolving. If a package is not documented under /docs, treat it as non-public."
  - question: "Do I need both theme and styles packages?"
    answer: "Use @kuzenbo/theme for token and runtime behavior. Add @kuzenbo/styles only when you want optional baseline global styles."
  - question: "What replaced the old core CSS entrypoint?"
    answer: "Use @kuzenbo/theme/prebuilt/kuzenbo.css for core styling, with optional @kuzenbo/styles/recommended.css for global baseline rules."
  - question: "How should I choose package ownership for new code?"
    answer: "Use @kuzenbo/core for UI primitives, @kuzenbo/hooks for reusable logic, and domain packages (charts, date, notifications, ai, datatable) for specialized features."
  - question: "What should I verify before upgrading versions?"
    answer: "Review changelog entries, confirm compatibility with your React/Next.js stack, and test critical user flows in your app."

## Quick Answers

## What should most teams install first?

For most apps, start with:

- `@kuzenbo/core`
- `@kuzenbo/theme`
- optional `@kuzenbo/styles`

Add feature packages only when your product needs them.

## Why can theme flash happen in SSR apps?

Theme flash usually means the bootstrap script runs too late.
Render `ThemeBootstrapScript` before app content and keep `ThemeProvider` wrapping your UI.

## Can I use raw Tailwind palette classes with Kuzenbo?

You can, but semantic token classes are recommended for long-term theming consistency.
Examples: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`, and status primitives.

## What is the safest migration order?

1. Update runtime setup (`@kuzenbo/theme`) first.
2. Move imports by domain package (`charts`, `date`, `notifications`).
3. Update tests and stories for changed API usage.
4. Roll out in small increments.
