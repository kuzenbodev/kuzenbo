## Quick Answers

## What should most teams install first?

For most apps, start with:

- `@kuzenbo/core`
- `@kuzenbo/theme`
- optional `@kuzenbo/styles`

Add feature packages only when your product needs them.

## Why can theme flash happen in SSR apps?

Theme flash usually means the bootstrap script runs too late.
Render `ThemeBootstrapScript` before app content and keep `ThemeProvider` wrapping your UI.

## Can I use raw Tailwind palette classes with Kuzenbo?

You can, but semantic token classes are recommended for long-term theming consistency.
Examples: `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`, and status primitives.

## What is the safest migration order?

1. Update runtime setup (`@kuzenbo/theme`) first.
2. Move imports by domain package (`charts`, `date`, `notifications`).
3. Update tests and stories for changed API usage.
4. Roll out in small increments.
