## Versioning Model

Kuzenbo uses lockstep versions for its public packages.
That means related packages are published with the same version number to reduce compatibility guesswork.
In almost all apps, keep `@kuzenbo/theme` versioned with the Kuzenbo UI packages you install.

## Channels You May See

- `latest`: stable production releases.
- `next`: pre-release stream for early adopters.

Use `next` only if you can validate changes in a staging environment before production.

## Install By Channel

```bash
bun add @kuzenbo/core@latest @kuzenbo/theme@latest
```

```bash
bun add @kuzenbo/core@next @kuzenbo/theme@next
```

## Upgrade Guidance

- Upgrade core runtime packages together (`core`, `theme`, and any domain packages you use).
- Keep `@kuzenbo/theme` in every UI package upgrade batch in almost all app setups.
- Read changelog entries before moving between channels.
- Prefer smaller version jumps over large jumps.
