## Where To Read Changes

Use these sources when planning an upgrade:

1. [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kuzenbodev/kuzenbo/releases) for version notes.
2. Repository `CHANGELOG.md` for a quick timeline view.
3. Package release pages on npm for published version history.

## What To Check In Each Release

- Breaking changes and migration notes.
- Component or hook API updates.
- Styling and theme runtime changes.
- Minimum framework/runtime updates.

## Upgrade Tip

Install explicit versions when validating large upgrades in your app:

```bash
bun add @kuzenbo/core@<version> @kuzenbo/theme@<version>
```

In almost all apps, upgrade `@kuzenbo/theme` together with the Kuzenbo UI packages you are validating.
