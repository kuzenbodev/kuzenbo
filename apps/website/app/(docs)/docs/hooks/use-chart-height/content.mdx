## What this hook does

`useChartHeight` is a Recharts layout hook re-exported by `@kuzenbo/charts`.
It returns the chart height in pixels from chart state.

## Reads and writes

- Reads: chart height from Recharts layout state.
- Writes: nothing. This hook is read-only.

## When to use it

- Switch tooltip/legend density based on available vertical space.
- Size custom overlays that should match full chart height.
- Build responsive chart internals without reading DOM manually.

## Import

```tsx
import { useChartHeight } from "@kuzenbo/charts";
```

## Example: compact mode when the chart is short

```tsx
"use client";

import { useChartHeight } from "@kuzenbo/charts";

export function HeightAwareLegendMode() {
  const chartHeight = useChartHeight();

  if (chartHeight === undefined) {
    return null;
  }

  const compact = chartHeight < 280;

  return (
    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      Legend mode: {compact ? "compact" : "full"} ({chartHeight}px)
    </p>
  );
}
```

## Example: safe fallback outside chart context

```tsx
const chartHeight = useChartHeight();
const effectiveHeight = chartHeight ?? 240;
```

## Return contract and edge cases

- Type: `number | undefined`
- `undefined` when used outside chart context.
- `undefined` before Recharts has reported chart size.
- Height includes chart container space (axes and legend areas are still within this number).
- Value does not scale with zoom level; it represents layout pixels.

## SSR and RSC caveats

- Client-only hook for components rendered inside chart trees.
- Keep chart runtime UI inside `"use client"` files.
- Always handle `undefined` to avoid hydration mismatches.
