## Get building in minutes

Add Kuzenbo to your React or Next.js app in a few steps. You need React 19 and your usual package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun).

## Quick path

Using Next.js App Router? Run this, then add the snippet below to your root layout:

```bash
npm i @kuzenbo/core @kuzenbo/theme @kuzenbo/styles react react-dom next-themes
```

In `app/layout.tsx`, add the theme script and provider (see [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) for the full snippet), import the CSS in `app/globals.css`, and you’re set.

## Step-by-step

Prefer a guided walkthrough? Follow:

1. [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) — exact commands for your package manager
2. [Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/quickstart) — build your first page
3. [Next.js](/docs/getting-started/nextjs) — App Router setup with SSR-safe theming

## What's next

- [Introduction](/docs/getting-started/introduction) — understand the packages
- [Styling](/docs/getting-started/styling) and [Theming](/docs/getting-started/theming) — tokens and dark mode

## Why separate packages?

Kuzenbo ships UI in focused packages so you only install what you use. Start with `core` and `theme`, then add `charts`, `date`, `notifications`, or `ai` when you need them.
