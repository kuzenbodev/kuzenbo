## Button at a Glance

`Button` is the action primitive in `@kuzenbo/core`.
It adds a variant system, size scale, and loading behavior on top of Base UI composition.
This page also covers `ButtonGroup`, `ButtonGroupSeparator`, and `ButtonGroupText` for grouped controls.

Use `Button` for actions.
Use links for navigation unless the interaction mutates state or triggers a command.

## Playground

Use the controls to preview `Button` states and sizing in real time.
Presets help you start from common production scenarios (`Default`, `Danger`, `Loading`).
