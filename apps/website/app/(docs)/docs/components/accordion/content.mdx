## Purpose

`Accordion` is the expandable disclosure primitive in `@kuzenbo/core`. Use it when you need progressive disclosure for settings, FAQs, or inspector panels while keeping keyboard support and slot composition consistent.

Boundaries for this page:

- Focuses on exported `Accordion` surface from `@kuzenbo/core`.
- Covers composition with `Accordion.Item`, `Accordion.Header`, `Accordion.Trigger`, and `Accordion.Content`.
- Does not cover app-specific state orchestration outside component usage.

## Installation

```npm
npm i @kuzenbo/core @kuzenbo/theme
```

## Import

```tsx
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionContent,
  AccordionHeader,
  AccordionItem,
  AccordionTrigger,
  accordionVariants,
} from "@kuzenbo/core/ui/accordion";
```

## Basic usage

```tsx
import { Accordion } from "@kuzenbo/core/ui/accordion";

export function BillingAccordion() {
  return (
    <Accordion className="w-full max-w-xl" variant="default">
      <Accordion.Item value="plan">
        <Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Trigger>Plan details</Accordion.Trigger>
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Content>
          Current plan: Pro. Renews on the 1st of each month.
        </Accordion.Content>
      </Accordion.Item>
      <Accordion.Item value="invoices">
        <Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Trigger>Invoices</Accordion.Trigger>
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Content>
          Download invoices from the billing history table.
        </Accordion.Content>
      </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion>
  );
}
```

## Advanced pattern: variant-driven styling

`Accordion` exposes a variant contract in both runtime props and `accordionVariants`.

```tsx
import { Accordion, accordionVariants } from "@kuzenbo/core/ui/accordion";

export function SettingsAccordion() {
  return (
    <section className="space-y-3">
      <h3 className="text-sm font-medium text-foreground">
        Workspace settings
      </h3>

      <Accordion className="w-full" variant="bordered">
        <Accordion.Item value="members">
          <Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Trigger>Members</Accordion.Trigger>
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Content>
            Invite, remove, and manage workspace roles.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>

        <Accordion.Item value="security">
          <Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Trigger>Security</Accordion.Trigger>
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Content>
            Configure 2FA policy and session limits.
          </Accordion.Content>
        </Accordion.Item>
      </Accordion>

      <p className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
        Variant class preview: {accordionVariants({ variant: "ghost" })}
      </p>
    </section>
  );
}
```

## Size scale

`Accordion` supports `xs | sm | md | lg | xl` sizing. The root `size` value cascades into trigger height/spacing and content spacing.

```tsx
import { Accordion } from "@kuzenbo/core/ui/accordion";

export function CompactFaqAccordion() {
  return (
    <Accordion size="xs" variant="ghost">
      <Accordion.Item value="shipping">
        <Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Trigger>Shipping policy</Accordion.Trigger>
        </Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Content>
          Orders typically ship within one business day.
        </Accordion.Content>
      </Accordion.Item>
    </Accordion>
  );
}
```

## API reference

- `Accordion`
  Root wrapper built on Base UI accordion root props plus `variant`.
  `variant` values: `default`, `bordered`, `ghost`.
  `size` values: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`.
- `AccordionItem`
  Item container. `value` should be unique within the same root.
- `AccordionHeader`
  Semantic heading wrapper that labels each trigger/panel pair.
- `AccordionTrigger`
  Interactive trigger for toggling each item.
- `AccordionContent`
  Expandable panel content region.
- `accordionVariants`
  Tailwind Variants helper used by root styling.

## Accessibility notes

- Use clear, action-oriented trigger text so screen readers can announce intent.
- Keep each primitive pair in semantic order (`Header` + `Trigger`, then `Content`).
- Validate focus visibility for every variant (`default`, `bordered`, `ghost`) in both light and dark themes.

## SSR and RSC notes

`Accordion` is interactive. In Next.js App Router, render it from a Client Component boundary (`"use client"`) or from a client child inside a server route.

## Styling and semantic tokens

Accordion styles already rely on semantic tokens such as `border-border` and `bg-background`. Extend with semantic utilities only:

- Use `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`.
- Use `text-muted-foreground` for helper copy.
- Avoid raw palette classes like `text-gray-500` or `bg-slate-100`.

## Troubleshooting

- Item does not expand:
  Confirm each `Accordion.Item` has a unique `value` and that trigger/content are correctly nested.
- Variant does not apply:
  Verify `variant` is one of `default`, `bordered`, `ghost`.
- Unexpected spacing in custom layouts:
  Check parent wrappers for conflicting `gap`, `padding`, or `overflow` utilities.
