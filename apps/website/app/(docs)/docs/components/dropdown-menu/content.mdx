## Legacy route

This route remains for documentation path compatibility.
The canonical surface uses `DropdownMenu` naming.
Sizing behavior is identical to the main page:

- Canonical tokens: `xs | sm | md | lg | xl`
- Default: `md`
- Cascade: `child size ?? content size ?? root size ?? "md"` for overlay surfaces.

Use the canonical page for current API names and subprimitives:

- [Dropdown Menu](/docs/components/menu)
