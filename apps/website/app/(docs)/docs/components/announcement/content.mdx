## Overview

`Announcement` is a compact inline status surface for product updates, release notes links, and feature callouts. It is a thin composition over `Badge` plus two optional slots (`AnnouncementTag`, `AnnouncementTitle`).

Use `Announcement` when you need an inline signal inside page content. Do not use it as a replacement for blocking alerts, toasts, or modal announcements.

## Installation

```npm
npm i @kuzenbo/core
```

## Import

```tsx
import {
  Announcement,
  AnnouncementTag,
  AnnouncementTitle,
} from "@kuzenbo/core/ui/announcement";
```

## Basic Example

```tsx
import {
  Announcement,
  AnnouncementTag,
  AnnouncementTitle,
} from "@kuzenbo/core/ui/announcement";

export function FeatureAnnouncement() {
  return (
    <Announcement>
      <AnnouncementTag>New</AnnouncementTag>
      <AnnouncementTitle>
        Chart presets are now available in docs.
      </AnnouncementTitle>
    </Announcement>
  );
}
```

## Advanced Example

```tsx
import {
  Announcement,
  AnnouncementTag,
  AnnouncementTitle,
} from "@kuzenbo/core/ui/announcement";

export function ReleaseAnnouncement() {
  return (
    <Announcement themed variant="outline" className="w-fit">
      <AnnouncementTag>Beta</AnnouncementTag>
      <AnnouncementTitle>
        AI widget presets shipped.
        <a
          className="ml-1 text-foreground underline underline-offset-4"
          href="/docs/components/ai-widget"
        >

        </a>
      </AnnouncementTitle>
    </Announcement>
  );
}
```

## API Reference

- `Announcement`
  Accepts `AnnouncementProps`, which extend `ComponentProps<typeof Badge>`, and adds:
  - `themed?: boolean` (default `false`) to enable themed slot styling.
  - `variant` defaults to `"outline"`.
- `AnnouncementTag`
  - `AnnouncementTagProps = HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`.
  - Designed for short, leading context like `New`, `Beta`, `Docs`.
- `AnnouncementTitle`
  - `AnnouncementTitleProps = HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`.
  - Main inline text container.

`Announcement.Tag` and `Announcement.Title` are also available via static composition on `Announcement`.

## Accessibility

- This component is visual by default. If announcement text changes dynamically, wrap it in an `aria-live="polite"` region.
- Keep announcement text explicit; avoid icon-only messaging.
- Ensure links inside `AnnouncementTitle` remain keyboard reachable and visibly focused.

## SSR and RSC Notes

- `Announcement` has no client-only state requirements by default and can render in server output.
- If you add dismiss logic or interactive state around it, move that wrapper to a Client Component.

## Styling and Tokens

- Default styles already use semantic tokens such as `bg-background`.
- Keep overrides token-based: `text-foreground`, `border-border`, `text-muted-foreground`.
- `themed` adds the `announcement-themed` state class used by `AnnouncementTag` for adjusted contrast.

## Troubleshooting

- Tag background does not react in themed mode: confirm `themed` is set on `Announcement` (root), not only on `AnnouncementTag`.
- Text gets clipped: `AnnouncementTitle` uses truncation defaults; add layout overrides (for example `whitespace-normal`) when multi-line copy is required.
- Import errors: use `@kuzenbo/core` exports only, not internal source paths.
