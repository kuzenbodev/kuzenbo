description: "Use Kuzenbo typography primitives for semantic hierarchy, consistent variants, and composable render targets."

## Typography Contract

Kuzenbo typography is built around semantic primitives, not ad-hoc class recipes.
Use `Typography` APIs so scale, hierarchy, and readability stay consistent across packages.

## Primitive Layers

`Typography` provides two composition layers:

- Semantic shortcuts: `Typography.H1`..`Typography.H6`, `Typography.P`, `Typography.Blockquote`, `Typography.Link`
- Variant primitives: `Typography.Heading` and `Typography.Text`

Use standalone `Code` from `@kuzenbo/core` for inline or block code snippets.

Variant primitives are useful when you need explicit control while preserving the token-backed variant system.

## Variant Model

Heading variants: `display`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `subheading`

Text variants: `body`, `lead`, `muted`, `small`, `caption`, `overline`, `eyebrow`

These are exported as `typographyHeadingVariants` and `typographyTextVariants`.

## Composition Example

Use `render` when typography must integrate with framework links or custom elements.

```tsx
import Link from "next/link";
import { Typography } from "@kuzenbo/core/ui/typography";

export function DocsHeroCopy() {
  return (
    <header>
      <Typography.H1>Build UI with predictable contracts.</Typography.H1>
      <Typography.Lead>
        Kuzenbo keeps theme, component, and package boundaries explicit.
      </Typography.Lead>
      <Typography.Link
        render={<Link href="/docs/getting-started/installation" />}
      >
        Start with installation
      </Typography.Link>
    </header>
  );
}
```

## Accessibility Rules

- Keep one clear `H1` per page-level surface.
- Do not skip heading levels for visual styling reasons.
- Preserve readable contrast for all text variants in light and dark themes.
- Prefer semantic typography components over raw tags with utility-heavy className stacks.

## Performance and Maintenance Notes

- Centralized typography variants reduce style drift across packages.
- Reusing primitives keeps docs and app surfaces visually aligned.
- If you need a new text role, extend the typography variant system instead of scattering one-off utilities.

## Common Pitfalls

- Styling raw `<h2>` and `<p>` tags directly when equivalent `Typography` primitives exist.
- Using heading variants for small helper text instead of text variants.
- Mixing raw palette color classes with semantic typography classes.
