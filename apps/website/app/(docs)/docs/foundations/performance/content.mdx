## Performance Model

Kuzenbo performance is a system concern across package exports, runtime configuration, and UI composition decisions.

## Baseline App Setup

Use a single global setup for theme and optional baseline styles.

```tsx
import type { ReactNode } from "react";

import "@kuzenbo/theme/prebuilt/kuzenbo.css";
import "@kuzenbo/styles/recommended.css";
import { ThemeBootstrapScript, ThemeProvider } from "@kuzenbo/theme";

export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <head>
        <ThemeBootstrapScript />
      </head>
      <body>
        <ThemeProvider>{children}</ThemeProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## High-Impact Rules

1. Import from the narrowest surface that matches your need.
2. Keep expensive transforms out of render and memoize stable chart/table config.
3. Keep client components small and push data fetching to server components when possible.
4. Avoid recreating formatter functions and large object literals in hot paths.
5. Keep overlays and animations respectful of reduced-motion preferences.

## Package-Specific Notes

- `@kuzenbo/charts`: stabilize `data`, `series`, and formatter references before passing them to prebuilt charts.
- `@kuzenbo/datatable`: memoize column definitions and avoid re-instantiating rows in render.
- `@kuzenbo/theme`: keep prepaint bootstrap active to avoid theme flicker and color-scheme jumps.
- `@kuzenbo/styles`: import once at the app shell level; do not repeatedly import in leaf components.

## Accessibility and Performance Together

Fast UI is not enough if interaction is unclear. Keep these paired checks:

- Keyboard path remains predictable after lazy loading or conditional rendering.
- Tooltip and dialog content remain readable with semantic colors in light and dark themes.
- Motion-heavy surfaces degrade gracefully when reduced motion is enabled.

## Consumer Verification Checklist

Before shipping performance-sensitive changes in your app:

- Run your app's normal build and test pipeline.
- Validate key flows in realistic screen sizes and slow-network scenarios.
- Compare before/after rendering behavior in the UI surfaces you changed.

## Troubleshooting

- If bundle size jumps after a change, audit import paths first and remove broad root imports that are not needed.
- If you see theme flicker, confirm `ThemeBootstrapScript` runs before client hydration.
- If chart/table views feel slow, memoize computed props and avoid recomputing large datasets in render.
