## How Kuzenbo is built

Kuzenbo is built on design tokens, accessibility primitives, and consistent patterns. This section explains how to use them well.
In almost all apps, pair the Kuzenbo UI packages you install with `@kuzenbo/theme`.

## Core concepts

- [Accessibility](/docs/foundations/accessibility) — focus, keyboard nav, ARIA
- [Color Primitives](/docs/foundations/color-primitives) — semantic tokens and when to use them
- [Typography System](/docs/foundations/typography-system) — text components and variants
- [Dark Mode](/docs/foundations/dark-mode) — theme runtime and preference detection
- [Theme Runtime](/docs/foundations/theme-runtime) — bootstrap script and provider behavior
- [RTL](/docs/foundations/rtl) — right-to-left layout support
- [Testing](/docs/foundations/testing) — component and hook testing patterns

## Implementation order

1. Install and wire `@kuzenbo/theme` (`ThemeBootstrapScript` + `ThemeProvider`)
2. Import theme CSS, then optional `@kuzenbo/styles/recommended.css`
3. Build screens with `@kuzenbo/core` and semantic tokens
4. Add feature packages (charts, date, notifications, ai, datatable) when you need them, while keeping `@kuzenbo/theme` installed

## Best practices

- **Semantic tokens** — Use `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border` instead of raw Tailwind palettes so dark mode and themes stay consistent
- **Typography** — Prefer Kuzenbo `Typography` components over ad-hoc class stacks on raw tags
- **Base UI patterns** — Use the `render` prop for composition; avoid introducing new `asChild` usage
