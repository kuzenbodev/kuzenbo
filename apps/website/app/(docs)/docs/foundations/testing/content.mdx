## Testing Approach

Test the behavior your users rely on: keyboard interaction, focus handling, labels, validation, and visible state changes.
Avoid brittle assertions tied to implementation details such as private class names.
When testing Kuzenbo UI packages, keep `@kuzenbo/theme` installed and load your theme runtime in shared test setup when needed.

## Recommended Test Stack

Use any test runner that fits your app (Vitest, Jest, or Bun test) with Testing Library utilities.

```bash
bun add -d @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event @testing-library/jest-dom happy-dom
```

## What To Cover First

- Opening and closing overlays from keyboard and pointer interactions.
- Disabled, loading, and validation states for form controls.
- Accessible names, roles, and labels for interactive UI.
- Regressions that previously caused production bugs.

## Integration Test Example

```tsx
import { describe, expect, it } from "bun:test";
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import { Button } from "@kuzenbo/core/ui/button";
import { Dialog } from "@kuzenbo/core/ui/dialog";

describe("settings dialog", () => {
  it("opens and closes through user actions", async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();

    render(
      <Dialog>
        <Dialog.Trigger render={<Button variant="outline" />}>
          Open settings
        </Dialog.Trigger>
        <Dialog.Portal>
          <Dialog.Overlay />
          <Dialog.Content>
            <Dialog.Title>Settings</Dialog.Title>
            <Dialog.Close render={<Button>Close</Button>} />
          </Dialog.Content>
        </Dialog.Portal>
      </Dialog>
    );

    await user.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Open settings" }));
    expect(
      screen.getByRole("dialog", { name: "Settings" })
    ).toBeInTheDocument();

    await user.click(screen.getByRole("button", { name: "Close" }));
    expect(
      screen.queryByRole("dialog", { name: "Settings" })
    ).not.toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Regression Checklist

- Add or update a failing test before applying a bug fix.
- Keep stories and tests aligned when component APIs change.
- Prefer user-level assertions (`role`, `name`, visible text) over internals.
