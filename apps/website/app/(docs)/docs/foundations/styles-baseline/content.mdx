## What `recommended.css` Is For

`@kuzenbo/styles/recommended.css` is an optional global baseline for app shells. It does not define component APIs. It standardizes low-level behavior so components from public packages render consistently.

Current baseline includes:

- Global border and outline token defaults.
- Color-scheme alignment (`light`/`dark`) for browser-native UI.
- Scrollbar appearance alignment with semantic border tokens and pointer-aware sizing.
- Font smoothing defaults on `html`.
- Reduced-motion-aware smooth scrolling with explicit reduce fallback.
- Scroll behavior guard when Base UI applies scroll lock.
- Root-level overscroll policy and stable scrollbar gutter.
- Global focus-visible baseline with fallback and forced-colors support.
- Long-text overflow protection for common content elements.
- Readable underline defaults for links.
- High-contrast semantic text selection colors.
- Optional sticky-header anchor offset hook via `--kb-anchor-offset`.

## Import Order Contract

Import order matters. Theme tokens must load first, then the optional baseline.

```tsx
import "@kuzenbo/theme/prebuilt/kuzenbo.css";
import "@kuzenbo/styles/recommended.css";
```

Do this once in your app shell or root layout.

If your app has a sticky header, set an offset once so hash links and focus targets are not hidden:

```css
:root {
  --kb-anchor-offset: 5rem;
}
```

## When To Use It

- You want a consistent global baseline across product pages.
- You are building a docs or dashboard app with many Kuzenbo surfaces.
- You do not want to maintain your own scrollbar and global outline baseline.

## When To Skip It

- You need a highly custom global reset and already own all base styles.
- You are building an embedded widget where host-page global styles must stay untouched.

## Accessibility Notes

- Keep reduced-motion behavior intact; do not force smooth scrolling globally.
- Preserve visible focus rings when customizing outlines.
- In forced-colors mode, prefer targeted adjustments only.
- Validate contrast and focus behavior after introducing additional global CSS.

## Performance Notes

- Import the baseline once. Repeated imports do not provide value and can complicate style debugging.
- Keep app-specific overrides small and layered after `recommended.css`.
- Avoid overriding semantic tokens with hardcoded palette values.

## Testing Notes

- Validate baseline effects in at least one light and one dark theme scenario.
- Add regression checks for scroll lock and focus visibility in overlay-heavy pages.
- Keep docs and app previews aligned with the same theme and baseline order.

## Troubleshooting

- If borders or outlines look inconsistent, verify that theme CSS is loaded before `recommended.css`.
- If smooth scrolling behaves unexpectedly during dialogs, confirm `html[data-base-ui-scroll-locked]` is not being overridden.
- If scrollbar styling disappears, check for competing global scrollbar rules in your app stylesheets.
- If native inputs/scrollbars look mismatched between themes, check where the `dark` class is applied on `html`.
