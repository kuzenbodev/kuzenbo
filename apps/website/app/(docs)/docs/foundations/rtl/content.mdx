## RTL Implementation Model

RTL support is not a late-stage visual tweak.
Treat direction as a layout and interaction requirement from the first component composition pass.

## Set Direction at the Correct Boundary

- Prefer document-level direction (`<html dir="rtl">`) for fully RTL products.
- Use section-level `dir` only when mixing LTR and RTL regions in one page.
- Keep text alignment and spacing logical (`text-start`, `text-end`) instead of hardcoded left/right assumptions.

## Component Composition Example

`Timeline` supports explicit direction, which is useful in mixed-direction dashboards.

```tsx
import { Timeline } from "@kuzenbo/core";

export function ReleaseTimeline() {
  return (
    <Timeline dir="rtl" orientation="vertical">
      <Timeline.Item>
        <Timeline.Header>
          <Timeline.Title>Release candidate</Timeline.Title>
          <Timeline.Time>09:00</Timeline.Time>
        </Timeline.Header>
        <Timeline.Content>
          <Timeline.Description>
            Package verification finished.
          </Timeline.Description>
        </Timeline.Content>
      </Timeline.Item>
    </Timeline>
  );
}
```

## Overlay and Navigation Notes

For dialogs, drawers, and menus in RTL locales:

- Verify entry/exit animation direction still feels natural.
- Ensure keyboard navigation order remains predictable.
- Confirm close and action controls are not visually mirrored into confusing positions.

## Styling Guidance

- Use semantic spacing and container composition instead of one-off directional overrides.
- Prefer CSS logical properties in custom styles (`margin-inline-start`, `padding-inline-end`) when utilities are not enough.
- Avoid transform hacks that flip entire containers unless the content is purely decorative.

## Testing Strategy

Run at least one integration test per critical flow in both directions:

- LTR baseline (`dir="ltr"`)
- RTL scenario (`dir="rtl"`)

Also perform visual QA for charts, pagination, and step-based components where directional cues matter most.

## Common RTL Regressions

- Icons imply direction but are never mirrored.
- Keyboard focus order follows DOM that no longer matches visual order.
- Text is RTL while interactive layout remains LTR.
